# Basic Instruction for Configuration

This is a client-server based programme, therefore, you have to run it with  software like Xampp

* Please Extract the Zip File (`fyp.rar) or clone the repo.
* Get a Xampp Software and add the extracted zip file to you `htdocs` folder

## Database Configuration

* Locate the file `rijwan_fyp`
* Import that `.sql` file into your database using PHP Admin or other means, Note that in my case, i use xampp software, while naming my database as `rijwan_fyp`, therefore, it is advisable to name your same way,
* Once done you should see the list of tables in your database, A typical example  is "category_group"

>Note: please locate config file under library and check for database configuration just in case you protect your database with password and you name your database as new name rather than `rijwan_fyp`

* Cretae the connection.php and name it accordingly which can be found under `Connections` folder
* Then locate this line where the hostname and database will be defined. 

```
@mysql_connect ("localhost", "root", "")
@mysql_select_db ("rijwan_fyp")
```
